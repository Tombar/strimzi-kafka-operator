= Security

The {ProductName} project supports data encryption of communication between the different Kafka and {ProductName} components by means of the SSL/TLS protocol.
This makes it possible to encrypt data transferred between Kafka brokers (interbroker communication), between Zookeeper nodes (internodal communication), and between clients and Kafka brokers.
For the Kafka and {ProductName} components, TLS certificates are also used for authentication.

The Cluster Operator sets up the SSL/TLS certificates to provide this encryption and authentication.
